<h2>Verse 10 & 11</h2>
<p> " [Verse 10, 11] Look up at me for a second. Does it say <em> some strategies of the devil </em>? What does it say? [Audience answered "ALL"] All, meaning any strategy that the enemy can use against the believer can be prevented by the use of the armor of God. <br><br> God does not hide the believer's freedom behind demonic or ancient mysteries, your Liberty in Christ does not depend upon whether you have a membership to ancestry.com or not. I have to find out it's not like in the movies, guys: 'I have to solve the riddle I have to put the puzzle together I have to go back and find where in my Generations' as if God is folding his arms looking down at you saying 'I would set you free but you don't know what your great-great grandmother did yet so I can't do anything'. My friend, whatever your family bloodline is, there's nothing more powerful than the blood of Jesus. <br> <br> So the Bible here says all strategies--nothing hidden, nothing that the enemy can bring forward that the scripture did not mention, nothing that the enemy can bring forward that solves some then that takes some riddle to solve that we're desperate to find the answer to, No! God lays it out plainly for you. <br><br> <u>You live by these precepts you will walk in Freedom</u>: that's what the scripture is telling us here. So you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil, every single one of them--that's what the Bible says.</p>
<h2>Verse 12</h2>
<p>[Verse 12], there's a lot to break down there but I want to Simply point out to you that hell is structured. There is a rank in command, a rank in file, in the kingdom of darkness. There is an organized effort against the children of God and they are coming after your faith. They're coming after your belief in the truth. <br> <br> There are some believers who are so obsessed with demonic power that they live in paranoia,  there are other believers who are so ignorant of demonic power they live in bondage and don't even know it! So we have to avoid demon Obsession but also ignorance about the demonic. Vigilant, not paranoid.But my friend, lest there be any mistake that we can make regarding this issue let me make it clear there is a spiritual Realm demons are real there is a spiritual battle going on over this world over the souls of this generation and we cannot pretend any longer like this isn't a conflict between light and darkness, because it is! We have to wake up we have to stop preaching things that take our Focus off the realm of the spirit. The Bible is fundamentally Supernatural, but many times we try to pretend as if it's superficially Supernatural as in the basics of it are mostly very just practical and so forth--and there is a practical application to everything in scripture, don't get me wrong--but many believe that we can live disconnected from this reality and to do so is detrimental to your spiritual life, and so again we must strike balance--not paranoid--and also not ignorant. So the Bible lists for us there there are powers, demons--that word is not a metaphor or just an idea or a figment of literature, these are actual beings that come against the people of God.
</p>
<h2>Verse 13</h2>
<p>[Verse 13] Now watch this again, put on <strong>every</strong> piece of God's armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil, then after the battle you will be standing firm. This is a command, you put it on, God provides it, you have to choose to use it. This is what many Believers don't understand about the power of the Holy Spirit: they're constantly begging for more of the Holy Spirit not realizing that everything the holy spirit is he dwells in you. When you were born again you did not receive a baby Holy Spirit, a portion of the Holy Spirit, a new convert Holy Spirit, a children's Church Holy Spirit, when you were born again the same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you! It's the same Holy Spirit and so this holy spirit gives us power gives us truth that's the life of the believer. <br> <br> You already have joy, you already have peace, you already have love, and power, and Grace, and Holiness. The issue is many of us aren't living a life and surrender to the Holy Spirit and therefore we never make use of that which he's already given to us. And so we're begging God for more and we're saying 'Holy Spirit I want more of you' When in reality it's not a matter of you getting more of the Holy Spirit, but of the Holy Spirit getting more of you. Surrender! <br> <br> So you put on the armor, now watch this: </p>
<h2>Verse 14</h2>

<p>[Verse 14], now let's break these down number one the belt of Truth what is the scripture describing here truth itself simple enough John 14:6 Jesus told him I am the way the truth and the life no one can come to the father except through me, John 17:17 Sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth. Jesus said if you build your life upon the sand--you build your <strong>house</strong> upon the sand, then when the storms come--<strong>not if the storms come</strong> when the storms come and whatever you built upon the sand will be knocked over. But if you build your house upon the rock--which is the word, the truth, the sayings of Jesus, the teachings of the master--you build your house upon the rock, then when the storms come your house will stand firm. <br> <br>You wonder why it's difficult to remain standing, you wonder why your faith goes up and down, you wonder why on Sundays you get recharged only to find yourself by Wednesday feeling like you're ready to backslide. Because many of us build our houses upon opinion, many of us build our houses upon emotion, many of us build our houses upon how we're doing that week, or what the circumstances dictate to us when we should build upon the words of Christ, the teachings, the truth that he has given to us. <br> <br>If you are not in the word, you are easy pray for the enemy. <strong>Why?</strong> because the enemies attack against the believer. Hear me now, and this is something I pray the Holy Spirit gives us all Revelation on. The way that the enemy attacks the believer is the one thing, <strong>deception</strong>. It's always deception, now you talk about the unbeliever--oh my goodness, there's a whole bunch more that's in his tool belt that he can use against them. But against the believer? It's just deception, because you've already been given and the power of the Holy Spirit, and the only way he can take any influence in your life is if you don't make use of what God has given to you. So he's constantly lying to you about who he wants you to think you are and you believe it, you'll never use what God gave you and so we must learn not just who we are, but more importantly who God is, what Christ has accomplished. So many Believers are in bondage because they don't understand their inheritance or identity in Christ, so many Believers are in bondage because they don't understand the work of Salvation they don't understand the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost. They don't understand what it means to walk in the glory of God, the life of the believer is meant to be one of victory. <br> <br> Now, I'm going to say something that may be offensive. But I'm going to say it anyway--not to offend--but to speak the truth, and then allow me to explain it. Because many times when you say things people hear another thing than what you're saying, so listen very carefully. <strong>If you are in bondage you are not living the Christian Life</strong>. now this is something you're not going to be told quite often, because many times preachers placate to itching ears--wanting to be told something else if you are in spiritual bondage--you're not living the Christian Life. <br> <br>Did you say I'm not a Christian? No! it's not what I said! I said you're not living the Christian Life, meaning you are not accessing what is rightfully yours. spiritual bondage--please hear this church--spiritual bondage is not a part of the Christian Life! we often think as though 'oh I'm in my struggling phase', and I understand that there are trials. I'm not saying we won't have emotions, I'm not saying we won't experience sorrow, I'm not saying we won't face difficult times, and difficult circumstances, we will face loss and tragedy. Yes, we will have trials. But that's not the same thing as a spiritual bondage or deception. See, a believer who walks in victory though they have trials they still have their joy and peace intact. but a Believer who's in bondage faces those trials and they think those trials are proof that God has abandoned them, they think those trials are proof that God didn't keep his word after all, they think those trials are proof that the enemy has any power over them whatsoever, and so because we always have trials they believe they're always under the power of the enemy. <br> <br>And so you look in the scripture and the life of the believer is described as victory. And we accept spiritual defeat? Again, I'm not talking about trials. We have to distinguish between the two. Spiritual defeat is not a part of the Christian Life, yet we say things, and we have this form of Pride that we surround ourselves with to protect us from actually addressing the issue, and we say things like 'well the enemy knows I'm such a big threat and that's why he has so much influence and that's why he's attacking me'. My friend, if you're a threat to the enemy he flees! And we wrap our identity around our struggles, you say 'well I've never wrapped my identity around my struggle'. You have wrapped your identity around your struggles if you accept those struggles because you think that's just a part of being anointed. <br> <br>Being anointed: people will come against you, there will be seasons of Doubt, there will be seasons of hardship, you will be persecuted, but <strong>never once did the scriptures say that we should be under spiritual bondage</strong>. and so we accept it as a part of the Christian Life and say 'well you know I'm so anointed that I'm just spiritually bound' and it's this backwards thinking when the scripture tells us that if you resist the enemy, he flees! He doesn't fight. You know why? <strong>Because the moment you start resisting he recognizes you just found out who you are</strong> and once you find out who you are, he says 'I have to flee'. But you see if we're not keen on how the enemy deceives, then when deception begins to permeate and intensify, we may be swept under certain mindsets that keep us thinking in defeat. And this is more than just positive thinking, this is truthful thinking rightful thinking, biblical thinking, the belt of Truth. <br> <br>And many of you are arguing against your own Deliverance. They get more offended that when you tell them the enemy doesn't have power of them than if you told them you didn't think they were saved. They're more quick to believe that maybe they weren't born again than to believe that they're no longer under bondage. <br> <br> Brothers and Sisters in Christ here, but you know, we accept these lies and we haven't grasped in truth and because we just accept the premise, we Grant the premise. We Grant the premise of the lies of the enemy and then he runs our lives through that influence. So that deceptive thought pattern that we have and we don't even realize we're the ones who gave him that in the first place. So we have to come back to the place where we're living in truth, truth about who God is, truth about your identity, truth about the new nature of the believer, truth about the power of the Holy Spirit living in you, that's the belt of Truth. <br><br>Now you know you're not walking in truth when you're swayed by worldly opinions. Let me put it to you this way: Truth by its very nature does not change. I don't care what the modern world says about any issue if it contradicts the truth of the word of God, you know you're not living in truth if you're swept up constantly by strange Doctrine getting all wrapped up in doctrines that just create legalism. You know how you know you're wrapped up in legalism? You have no peace. You know how you know you're wrapped up in strange Doctrine? It is when the doctrines bring you more paranoia and they do power you, forget about who you are in Christ, you know you're not living in truth when you when you do things based upon your own thoughts and emotions. Well, are Jesus Lord or are your emotions the Lord of your life? <br><br>See? because if you live according to your emotions, your emotions change! And therefore so will the direction of your life. But if you live according to truth, no matter how you feel you have a fixed purpose. So that's about the truth. <br><br>number two the body armor of righteousness. Romans 4:3 for the scripture tells us Abraham believed God and God counted him as righteous because of his faith. Righteousness is a gift, righteousness is a gift from God when you believe God and put your faith in what Jesus has done on the cross. Then, he grants to you righteousness, it's imputed righteousness once you've placed your faith in Christ. And this is one of the true miracles of Salvation, And This truly is one of the great lifters of the burden that many of us have carried. When you recognize who you are in Christ you come to know this wonderful reality that when God looks at the cross he sees your sins and when God looks at you he sees Christ's perfection. Now, that can only be granted by faith you believe. Therefore, he gives that to you. That's the gift of salvation. So this righteousness in which we live, is only stabilized, it is only received, is only acted upon or lived out when we live in truth in the scripture. <br><br>The armor that's being described is an ancient armor and that breastplate of righteousness, the body armor of righteousness was held in place by the belt. So, therefore, we see in Scripture that truth is what fastens righteousness to us. Jesus said you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free. If you're bound in a sin, in an addiction of some sorts, you're bound in a cycle of habits that you can't seem to break: I promise you this, somewhere deep down you are believing a lie that's keeping you bound to that sin, and that truth that you're not living in, that lack of Truth makes it difficult to hold to yourself, The body armor of righteousness. </p> <h2>Repent and Renounce</h2> <p>Now I don't have time to completely dissect this because there's many other points I want to make, but we want to talk about repentance here just for a second. To repent means to change your mind. Now when I say that some Believers get offended, they say 'no you must turn around that's what you must do' and I agree you must turn from sin, yes, but that's still not what the word repent means though. The Bible does say we must turn from sin as well. To repent means to change your mind, to renounce means to turn from. Now here's the issue, many: 'God I agree this sin is destructive', 'God I agree this sin will not fulfill me', because if you sin you believe the lie that it will fulfill you. If you sin, you believe the lie that it will not destroy you--otherwise you wouldn't be doing it. So I agree that this sin is destructive, I agree that this sin will not fulfill me, I agree that this sin must go now and for all time. Because here's what we do and the flesh is so tricky, we lie to ourselves when it comes to repentance: we say before God 'God I'm going to put this sin away' and the flesh Whispers '(for now)', 'God, no more! I'm giving this up!' and the flesh says '(until the Cravings become strong again)'. So even though we say with our mouths, even though we really wanted to, many times it's not sin we want to be freed from, but the consequences of sin. Many times it's not sin you want to be freed from, it's from the guilt that sin brings. 'Lord relieve the guilt but let me keep the sin' and then they get stuck in the cycle. Feeling bad is not repentance, and so you believe according to the Flesh, and then you're lying to yourself, and then you try to renounce and turn from it, well you're battling with yourself. So to repent means I change my mind about it completely, and now I can renounce it. By the way, renounce means to turn from. We've ritualized repentance and renouncing to what we think it's just a list that we read off, of you know we get the scroll and he rolls all the way across the floor: 'I renounce this, I renounce this, before this, as I renounce this' and if it really was biblical we had to renounce everything our ancestors way back to Adam & Eve! And then a perfect record of everything in between, but that's not what--you can do that, there's nothing wrong with that inherently. If you want to verbalize the fact that you're rejecting the sins of your ancestors, go for it! That's a beautiful thing and it's good that your children see you do it, 'we renounce drug addiction, we renounce alcohol', right? You can do that, but that's still not what that word means. Because many of us will read off of a paper or say a ritualized prayer will never turning from that sin and then wonder why it still has its consequences manifesting in our lives. So we've made it a religion, we've ritualized it, this is where we have to come to the place where we're saying 'I'm going to hold myself to righteousness in the truth and that truth will be held to me fast, and I will agree God this has to go, I turn in my mind from this sin, and I also renounce it in my everyday life'. <br><br> I'll briefly survey some of the other pieces of the armor: the shoes of peace. This is your readiness to preach the gospel, now I do find it ironic, I think that's the word that I should be using, I think it's ironic that the shoes of peace are the means by which we take territory. See, we don't conquer in the manner of worldly kingdoms, we don't expand territory through violence. When we take steps with the shoes of peace, we are taking the Declaration of the Gospel everywhere we go and everywhere that the gospel goes the hearts of prisoners are set free. Everywhere that the gospel goes, truth advances! You see, we expand our kingdom by sharing the gospel and every time a life is transformed that life touches a family, that family touches a region, that region shakes Nations, and so the shoes of peace is the truth of the Gospel. <br><br>Are you seeing a theme here? truth, truth, truth. Number Four, The Shield of faith. The Shield of faith is your belief in what God has said. Spiritual warfare ultimately is the fight to believe God's truths over the enemy's lies, that's spiritual warfare. It's that battle in the minds to hold fast to truth. The fiery darts of the enemy that are launched at you, that's deception, that's a lie, and just as the shield quenches that fiery Dart, so truth quenches deception. Fire like deception spreads if it's not addressed immediately. <br><br>Everything about the kingdom of hell is built on shifting Shadow. Oh I pray we understand this in the name of Jesus, everything about the kingdom of hell is built on shifting shadow: Brick by Brick, Lie by lie, the fortresses of hell are built. The weapons of the enemy are nothing more than sharp silhouettes. And just as a shadow can appear larger in the right perspective, so the power of the enemy can seem larger than it actually is when we live under the power of deception. The enemy's power everything he can do against us, it's a smoky illusion that only works if we give in to the belief in his lie. When you enter a dark room, hopefully you don't scream at the darkness to try to get it out! All the enemy doesn't care at all if you raise your voice, he's not intimidated by our tactics, or our Firm Stance, or our raised voice, he doesn't care about how much we think we know about the spiritual Realm, the enemy fears one thing: <a href=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204%3A4-6&version=NLV> it is written </a>. The kingdom of hell is built upon shadowy illusion, and the moment the light is turned on--everything in the kingdom of God of Darkness dissolves. Everything in the kingdom of darkness dissolves once that light is introduced. <br><br>So shoes of peace, we take the gospel, Shield of faith, we believe in the truth of what God has said, helmet of salvation just cross-reference this with first Thessalonians 5:8 and you'll see that the helmet of salvation is your confidence in Salvation. Oh the enemy wants to shake you from that. You know it's not God's will that you live your life wondering if you're saved, in fact and this may shake you up but that's okay it'll get you studying in the right direction. If you live your life constantly wondering if your last mistake was the one to finally do you in and cause you to lose your salvation, then you believe a workspace gospel, legalism, you want to know how you're bound by legalism? You want to know if you're bound by legalism? If you're constantly fearing the loss of your salvation you are bound by legalism. Now, again, I know I'm preaching some things that are shaking some people up but it's good to be shaken up sometimes because we need to come back to the truth. Now, again, people say what does that mean I can live however I want? No! Because a true believer would desire to live holy! And the sword of the spirit which is the word of God, the spirit of truth works in conjunction with the word of Truth. The Holy Spirit will remind and reveal concerning truth, and when we're faced with those battles where the enemy is coming against us: we must hold fast to the truth of the word of God. When culture tries to pressure you into believing and preaching according to how they believe, you hold fast on Truth. Do not be deceived, they'll call you a bigot, they'll call you old-fashioned, they'll call you out of touch, they'll call you narrow-minded. Just smile and say: 'yes I am narrow-minded because Jesus said narrow is the way, I am narrow-minded!' Some people are so open-minded their brains are falling out, they just take anything for granted and believe everything that comes their way. Now, I'm narrow-minded, Jesus is the way, Jesus is the way! There's no name under Heaven given amongst Men by which we are saved other than the name of Jesus. There's no other name, no other name, no other name. Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life, no man comes to the father except through me. So we stand fast in the face of adversity, in the face of persecution, and yes, criticism, and slander, and rejection, that is a form of persecution. You stand fast in the armor of God. <br><br>When the enemy comes to attack you, he throws a lie at you, and that fiery Dart--and you know the thing about a lie is that a lie doesn't become deception until you believe it. When I tell a lie, if I say to you something that's untrue and you reject that lie you're not deceived! So the enemy crafts his lies to try to make them as believable as possible, and he hurls these fiery Dart sounds: 'God has rejected you', the lie that's been launched the fiery Dart, but then I take the shield of faith and I believe in the promise 'I will never leave thee nor forsake thee' and so you hold that Shield up, and it quenches the fiery guard of the enemy. Then you go after that attacker with the sword of the spirit it's with the shield of faith that we quench the fiery darts. It's with the sword that we cut down the Liars themselves, those demonic powers. The enemy says 'God holds your past against you', that's a fiery Dart launched... Shield of faith: 'if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins', the enemy launches 'nothing good will ever happen to you, you're bound for defeat, God has rejected you', Shield of faith: 'I cling to it and believe, I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future'. (The enemy says) 'Your family will never be saved', (Shield of faith:) 'nothing is impossible with God'. (The enemy says) 'This sickness is going to keep you bound', (Shield of faith:) 'By his stripes I am healed'. Resist the devil and he'll flee like a coward! <br><br> I want to live in the truth, I want to live in the power that God has made available to me, it's time you stand in who you are, it's time you stand upon truth."</p>
