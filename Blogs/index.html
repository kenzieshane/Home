	 <p class=notice> &nbsp <strong>(i) INFO: </strong><em>Published on Friday, 29th November 2024. Author: Kenzie Shane S.</em></p>
	    <p class=blogpreview> Combination is used in the context of questions that do not pay attention to the order when taking/choosing something from the source, Permutation is used in the context of questions that require a sequence (usually marked by questions that ask 'how many (number of) ways are available to achieve something, etc') because the answer obtained without order will always be different from the one that is obtained. So thus Permutation is needed to sort that out instead of just using Combination. </p>
