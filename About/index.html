	<h1>Hello! So...About me, huh?</h1>
	<p><strong>I'm from Indonesia! For more in-depth, you should scroll a bit down.</strong><p>

	<hr>

	<p><strong>And here are some bible verses, if you don't mind! :)</strong></p>
	<p>2 Corinthians 4:16-18 ~ So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</p>
	<p>Romans 8:38-39 ~ 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in <strong>Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p>
